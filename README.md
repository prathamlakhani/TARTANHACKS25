# Campus Ticketing and Meal Plan Exchange App (XRP Ledger)

## Overview
This project is a **decentralized campus ticketing and meal plan exchange system** powered by the **XRP Ledger (XRPL)**. It allows students to **buy event tickets, exchange meal credits, and manage their transactions** seamlessly using **XRP tokens**.

## Problem It Solves
- **Limited Access to Campus Events** – Traditional event ticketing systems often have inefficiencies such as delays, lack of transparency, and difficulty in reselling tickets.
- **Wasted Meal Credits** – Many students are left with unused meal credits at the end of the semester, leading to financial waste.
- **Lack of Transparency** – Students often have limited insight into their spending and balances related to campus expenses.
- **Complicated Transactions** – Managing payments between students for tickets and meal credits is often done informally, leading to potential disputes.

## How It Works
- **Event Ticketing System** – Students can **buy, sell, and transfer tickets** for campus events using XRP.
- **Meal Credit Exchange** – Students can **exchange unused meal credits for XRP**, making their balances more flexible.
- **Student Wallets** – Each student has a **unique ID** and a **secure XRP wallet** to store their event tickets and meal credits.
- **Seamless Transactions** – The system **tracks** all transactions and updates balances in real-time.
