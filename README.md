Campus Ticketing and Meal Plan Exchange App (XRP Ledger)
Overview
This project is a decentralized campus ticketing and meal plan exchange system powered by the XRP Ledger (XRPL). It allows students to buy event tickets, exchange meal credits, and manage their transactions seamlessly using XRP tokens.

Problem It Solves
Limited Access to Campus Events – Traditional event ticketing systems often have inefficiencies such as delays, lack of transparency, and difficulty in reselling tickets.
Wasted Meal Credits – Many students are left with unused meal credits at the end of the semester, leading to financial waste.
Lack of Transparency – Students often have limited insight into their spending and balances related to campus expenses.
Complicated Transactions – Managing payments between students for tickets and meal credits is often done informally, leading to potential disputes.
How It Works
Event Ticketing System – Students can buy, sell, and transfer tickets for campus events using XRP.
Meal Credit Exchange – Students can exchange unused meal credits for XRP, making their balances more flexible.
Student Wallets – Each student has a unique ID and a secure XRP wallet to store their event tickets and meal credits.
Seamless Transactions – The system tracks all transactions and updates balances in real-time.
